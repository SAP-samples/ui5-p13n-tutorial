# P13nify Everything - Personalization for Any Control

## Description
In this tutorial you can learn how to add personalization capabilities to almost every control. If you have a custom control that you would like to enhance with filtering, sorting, or other options this tutorial is for you.

You will be lead through the enablement of a custom control using the assets provided by UI5. You can also learn, how to use those assets to enhance your application with personalization capabilities. You should be able to apply your knowledge afterwards in your own application or control development.

### UI5 Components in Focus
* [`sap.m.p13n.Engine`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.p13n.Engine)
* [`sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement)
